Seamless Google Api integrations.  
Google Maps.  

Feel free to contribute, throw questions and report issues. **I usually respond fast (24-48 hours).**  
Do you need support for an additional .Net framework?, let me know.  

### Using the Library
The library may be consumed, either by using the individual facede implementations or by depdendency injecting the individual api's.  
Each api implementation consists of a request and a response. The request has properties reflecting the parameters supported, and the response represents the object model for the returned json.  

A few other noteworthy members.

```csharp
var uri = request.GetUri(); // Gets the full request uri, including query parameters.
var params = request.GetQUeryStringParameters(); // Gets a list of all the added parameters.
```
```csharp
response.RawJson // The raw json returned by Google.
response.RawQueryString // The querystring sent to Google when invoking the request.
```

#### Facade
Each api has a generic facade operation to execute the request and return the response.  
The example below, simply populates a request, invokes the facade operation, and recieves the response in return.  
```csharp
TRequest request = new TRequest();
TResponse response = await {Api}.[{SubGroup}].{Action}.QueryAsync<TRequest, TResponse>(request);
```
See below for a full list of supported Api's and actions.  


#### Dependency Injection
If injecting the api's as dependencies is preffered register the services during startup, as shown below.  

```csharp
services
    .AddGoogleApiClients();
```
Then, inject the individual Api's in constructors as needed
```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private {Api}.[{SubGroup}].{Action} api;
    
    public MyClass({Api}.[{SubGroup}].{Action} api)
    {
        this.api = api
    }
}
```
See below for a full list of supported Api's and actions.

##### Google Maps
  * Directions (```GoogleMaps.Directions```)

  * Geolocation (```GoogleMaps.Geolocation.PlusCodeGeocode```)
  * Roads
    * Nearest Roads (```GoogleMaps.Roads.NearestRoads```)
    * Snap To Roads (```GoogleMaps.Roads.SnapToRoad```)
    * Speed Limits (```GoogleMaps.Roads.SpeedLimits```)
  * Time Zone
  * Street View
  * Static Maps

##### Google Functions

### Running Test Suite
Running the test suite is simple.  

The test project stores settings related to your Google subscription (free or paid) in `application.default.json`.  
Most importantly, the ```ApiKey```, used to identify the Google subscription.  
```json
{ 
  "ApiKey": "",
  "SearchEngineId": "",
}
```
